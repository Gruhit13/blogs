                            If you have started machine learning and performed a classification project then you would 
                            have surely come across these words quite often and if you are like me that you would have 
                            mugged up the formula for it as well. And looking at the extreme importance of these two 
                            terms it seems even reasonable to mug up the formula along with briefly understanding 
                            what it actually means. </p>

                            Precision and Recall are those two metrics in machine learning that is used to evaluate how 
                            well the model is able to remember the dataset along with how well it has understood it. 
                            Precision is responsible for accounting the understanding of dataset part whereas recall 
                            is responsible for evaluating the remembering part.

                            In my initial days of learning machine learning (Yeah that’s how I say that I am still learning 
                            the domain of machine learning by putting machine patties between 2 slices of learning, resulting 
                            in ‘learning machine learning’), I was so fascinated on how my program was able to classify between 
                            any digit from 0-9. And that was even the point where I first met these two friends of mine called 
                            Precision and Recall. Precision and Recall are less sung heroes of machine learning. They are 
                            crucial but merely a few machine-learning learners know what it actually says. But guess what you 
                            will get to know today what it actually means. And that is really fantastic!!!!

                            In order to know what precision and recall is you need to know what the confusion matrix is and in 
                            order to know that you need to know why we need it. So we will break our this session in 2 Parts:

                            Theoretically a confusion matrix is like a report card of the model that basically tells you how 
                            well the model was on classifying the labels and how often it made mistake(s). Technically speaking, 
                            confusion is a matrix displaying the count of a model's correct and incorrect prediction of classes. </p>

                                It is difficult to think of a major industry that AI will not transform. This includes healthcare,
                                education, transportation, retail, communications, and agriculture. There are suprisingly clear paths
                                for AI to make a big difference in all of these industries.

                            <h3>How can I get a confusion matrix? 😕</h3>
    
                            <p>
                            For this, let's assume that you have trained a model for a binary classification task where a sample 
                            data-point has a certain probability of falling in 1 of 2 classes. For that model, you provide it validation 
                            or testing dataset and retrieve the output for each of the points in the validation dataset. Now you compare 
                            the response from the model with the true value(in ML terminology we call true or actual value as ‘Ground Truth’, 
                            it seems more fancy and showcases that you know machine learning). For a binary classification task there can 
                            be 4 possible outcomes when you compare the model's prediction with the ground truth values (never leave a chance 
                            to show off!). A representation of those 4 possible values is what a confusion matrix is.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                You would have obvisouly seen confusion matrix a lot of time so let me represent it in a way that would make more sense.
                                Take a look at this representation of confusion matrix 👇
                            </p>

                            <figure class="alignwide">
                                <img src="../images/Blog1/confusion_matrix.png" 
                                     srcset="../images/Blog1/confusion_matrix.png" sizes="(max-width: 2400px) 100vw, 2400px" alt="">
                            </figure>
                            <p>
                            <b>Example:</b> Here we will create a model that takes an image as input and predict if it is a dog or cat. So for a certain 
                            set of images that model will tell us which of the models it thinks is a cat and which is a dog.
                            </p>
                                    
                            <p>
                            Note: It is not necessary that the model correctly predicts each image and hence to identify the model's interpretation 
                            for cat and dog we have this confusion matrix.
                            </p>
    
                            <p>
                            Here the person with a green T-shirt is our model whereas the other character is our ground truth. The model provides its 
                            opinion to which the ground truth reveals the truth. Now each of the 4 cases has its corresponding case and that is what 
                            confuses most of the people so in order to simplify its nomenclature (a system of naming, told ya! I do not leave a chance to show off) 
                            we will break the case name in 2 words.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            <b>Word 1)</b> Says whether the model’s prediction is correct (True) or incorrect (False)
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            <b>Word 2)</b> Says the model’s prediction about a data point being of category 1 (Positive/Cat) or category 2 (Negative/Dog).
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            Here, instead of Dog/Cat there can be any pair of categories (Malignant/Benign, Churn/Not Churn, etc)  and hence in general we 
                            split the categories usually as Positive and Negative. Taking a category name as Negative does not mean that model is doing 
                            something wrong; it's just a general name provided to the category. And hence based on the category name we have labels as 
                            Positive and Negative.
                            </p>

                            <ol>
                                <!--  True Positive  -->
                                <b><li>True Positive (TP)</li></b>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                    This case arrives when the model correctly predicts the true category. What I mean is the image provided to the model 
                                    was of cat and the model correctly identifies it as cat. So the model's prediction for that image is cat which is right 
                                    or in machine learning terms it is true.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                    As it correctly or <b>truely predicted</b> a data point of the <b>Positive category</b> we call this case as <b><u>True Positive.</u></b> 
                                    Stating that the model has truly predicted the Positive category’s data point.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                <!--  False Negative  -->
                                <b><li>False Negative (FN)</li></b>

                                    This scenario will occur when the model was given a cat image but the model predicted it as a dog which is wrong(False). 
                                    As the model is <b>falsely stating</b> that the image is of dog which is <b>Negative Category</b> whereas actually, the 
                                    image is of cat we call this case as <b><u>False Negative</u></b>.

                                    <li>
                                    False negative means originally the data-point(Image in our case) belonged to the Positive class(Cat class in our project) but the 
                                    model falsely predicted it as Negative Class. Hence it is called False Negative.
                                    </li>

                                    This case is similar to False Negative. Based on the name you would have obviously guessed what it means but

                                    This case occurs when the model is actually given a dog’s image as input but it predicts it as cat. As the model <b>falsely 
                                    predicts</b> that the data point belongs to the Cat class which is which is the <b>Positive class</b>, this case is called 
                                    <b><u>False Positive</u></b>.

                                    This case occurs when the model is given an image of a dog and it correctly identifies it as being a dog. As the model <b>truly

                            NOTE: There is no mandate that the 1st category must always be positive and 2nd category must be positive, this is mainly done for 
                            simplicity and basically the first person who made the confusion matrix decided to make it that way so it's like this.

                            If you are willing to pursue your career in the machine learning domain then you will end up seeing many variations to this simple 
                            confusion matrix where the labels start from negative and then we have positive and so on. But that would be just a trick of your 
                            professor to make the question look tough. So do not get scared by it and remember my above given words of wisdom. 😉😇

                            These 4 cases might seem a mathematical combination of possible values but it actually means a lot. As it says, the model 
                            understanding of the data. This report card of the model further assists us in making decisions on what changes to make to improvise 
                            model performance. But for any machine learning task we want the model to correctly identify all the data points of their respective 
                            category i.e. we want the model to increase the values of True Positives and True Negatives whereas reduce the False Negative and False Positive.

                            And here you are knowing all the black and white of confusion matrix so now let’s move further to knowing our friends precision 
                            and recall but before that quick revision.

                            <p>Okay, now it's time to march forward for precision and recall.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Precision 🎯</h3>

                            <p>
                            The formula that you would have known about precision goes like this:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            $$ Precision = \frac{TP}{TP + FP} $$
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            If I had to say it to you verbally then I would say 
                            “Precision is the true positive divided by the sum of all the labels that the model predicted to be positive”. 
                            Now if you see I said “all the labels model predicted to be positive” so by all the labels I mean that the model 
                            has predicted certain labels as positive which were positive but in addition to that the model even predicted certain 
                            labels as positive which were not positive but here we will consider that as well.                                
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Mathematically, equating:
                            <br>
                            Total Positive according to Model = Truly identified positive labels + Falsely stated positive labels
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            A ratio of True positive over total positive according to the model will tell you that out of all the positive 
                            labels predicted by the model how many are actually true.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Let us take an example to understand this thing. Let’s say we have 10 apples out of which 5 are green and 5 are red. 
                            We want the model to correctly identify them but if a human can make a mistake so can the human made ML model and hence 
                            it makes a mistake which is displayed in our confusion matrix.
                            </p>

                            <figure class="alignwide">
                                <img src="../images/Blog1/ConfMat2.png" 
                                     srcset="../images/Blog1/ConfMat2.png" sizes="(max-width: 2400px) 100vw, 2400px" alt="">
                            </figure>
                            
                            <p>
                            So from this matrix, if we have to calculate the total number of positive(green) apples predicted by the 
                            model then that will be this portion of the matrix
                            </p>

                            <figure class="alignwide">
                                <img src="../images/Blog1/TotalPredPos.png" 
                                     srcset="../images/Blog1/TotalPredPos.png" sizes="(max-width: 2400px) 100vw, 2400px" alt="">
                            </figure>
                            
                            <p>
                            Thus the total positive according to the model is 5 out of which 3 are truly green apples and 2 apples were misclassified 
                            by the model as being green despite being red. Thus based on our formula
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            $$ Total \ true \  predicted \  by  \ model = 3 + 2 = 5 $$
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Thus we calculate precision as <br>
                            $$ Precision = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6 $$
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Here the model’s precision is 0.6. Now what does this tell us? This basically tells us that out of all the apples that the 
                            model predicted to be positive only 60%  are positive so this says the model’s capability in identifying green apples.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            This metric says how well the model is in identifying a category truly. Thus this metric emphasises on the model’s capability 
                            to correctly classify a label. On a general note, precision says that out of all the labels that the model thinks to be of category 
                            1 how many actually are of category 1? If all of the model’s predicted category 1 labels are actually of category 1 then the model 
                            has understood the features of categories 1 and 2.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Recall 💡</h3>

                            <p>
                            The formula for recall that we know is <br>
                            $$ recall = \frac{TP}{TP + FN} $$
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Over here the denominator is the sum of all the true values that within the dataset i.e in the given dataset how many labels are 
                            actually positive or true. And that value is obtained by summing the labels that the model truly identified as being true and those 
                            labels that the model falsely identified as negative because those labels were also actually true. Thus over here the denominator 
                            is the total number of sample in the dataset that belonged to Green Apple (class 1, class Positives, etc).
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            $$ total \ Positives \ in \ the \ dataset = Truly \ identified \ positive \ labels + Falsely \ stated \ Negative \ labels $$
                            </p>

                            <figure class="alignwide">
                                <img src="../images/Blog1/TotalTruePos.png" 
                                     srcset="../images/Blog1/TotalTruePos.png" sizes="(max-width: 2400px) 100vw, 2400px" alt="">
                            </figure>

                            <p>
                            The ratio of True positive over all the labels that are actually true in our dataset is what recall is and 
                            this case we can calculate recall as <br>
                            $$ recall =  \frac{3}{5} = 0.6 $$
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Recall says that out of all the labels that were true in the dataset the model was able to recall its learning 
                            from the training dataset and predict 60% of labels as true correctly.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Thus recall says how well the model is able to remember the knowledge it acquired from the training dataset 
                            and use it to identify the unseen dataset. Recall in general says that out of all the labels of category 1 
                            in the dataset how many the model was able to identify successfully? So out of all the green apples that we had, 
                            how many of them does the model predict to be green?
                            </p>
                            
                            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                            <p>
                            This was the essence behind the precision and recall. Thus precision and recall being so simple is yet a crucial 
                            aspect in machine learning as it tends to say a lot. As a form of exercise try thinking of scenarios of what a 
                            high precision would mean and what a high recall would mean.
